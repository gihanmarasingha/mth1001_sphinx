What is a theorem? What is a proof?
-----------------------------------

The principal aim of this module is for you to learn how to create and write mathematical proofs.
In the process, you will learn topics that will be fundamental for every pure mathematics module in
the remainder of your degree.

A theorem is the assertion that a particular statement can be derived from given assumptions by a
logically rigorous process.

Here's a simple example.

.. proof:theorem::

  Given :math:`x+2 = 5`, we have :math:`x=3` or :math:`x=0`.

In the above theorem, the statement to be derived is ':math:`x=3` or :math:`x=0`'.
