# MTH1001 in Lean

These are Lean-based lecture notes for the University of Exeter module MTH1001
(Mathematical Structures).

These notes depend on Lean, VS Code, and mathlib.
You can install them following the instructions
in the mathlib repository,
<https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib>.

To use this tutorial, you need to set up a project folder.
Open a terminal and type:
```
leanproject get https://github.com/gihanmarasingha/mth1001_sphinx
```
Then open the project in VS Code:
```
code mth1001_sphinx
```
Once VS Code starts, open the file `welcome.lean`.
That will load the notes in a
separate window, and you are good to go.
